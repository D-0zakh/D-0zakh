## Challenges:

### 1.Web:
-  #### Simple Web:
    1.Opened the Deployment of the website.
   
    2.Clicked on inspect and headed to the Sources page and chose script.js.

   3.Scrolled down untill a list of words was found and looked promising enough to be the flag.

   4.Used Base64 in order to decode the given text.

   5.The flag was wired{m5_Dh0n1_1S_b3sT_c4Pt14N}

   6.Another way to get the flag was to figure out the Username and Password to the website. This would display a pop up which shows u the flag to be deciphered.
    
### 2.Crypto:
-  #### Crypto Layers:
    1.In order to recieve the flag, the message had to be decoded in Binary > Caesar(shift of 5) > Vignere.

    2.The Binary text was converted into Swby70Hqd3u5Jn3S00q (into Caesar).

    3.The Caesar text was converted into Nrwt70Cly3p5Ei3N00l (into Vignere) with a shift of 5.

    4.The Vignere text was converted into Cryp70Lay3r5Ar3C00l (the flag) with the key as "LAYER".

    5.The HINT really helped me to get throught and solve the challenge.
-  #### da_french_cipher:
    1.wmzsx{w3pk0a3_n0_tl3_e0ffd_0j_k1db3rw} had to be decoded using a french cipher language.

    2.It could either be Caesar or Vignere. Vignere was used to decipher the message in order to get the flag.

    3.wmzsx{w3pk0a3_n0_tl3_e0ffd_0j_k1db3rw} was converted into wired{w3lc0m3_t0_th3_w0rld_0f_c1ph3rs} with keys as the vowels (AEIOU).
   
### 3.Wireless:

-  #### what's_up_DoH:
   1.This task was completed with the help of the software "Wireshark".

   2.The given file was opened in Wireshark.

   3.Using the search bar (Ctrl+F), and seraching 'idk567', I was able to find 'idk567.my.canva.site' inside a packet.

   4.Searching for such a website reveals a image of Spongebob on the screen.

   5.The flag is wired{Spongebob_Squarepants} , which can be found in the inspect bar or by just typing out the name of the character on the screen.

### 4.Reversing:
-  #### grep it:
    1.This task wasn't completed using Linux. The file was opened in notepad.

    2.'wired' was typed into the search bar and the flag 'wired{Argentnia_cant_even_beat_Saudi_Arabia}' was found out to be the flag.

~~The flag did hurt me :(~~ 

-  #### 0R_bu7_3xCLus1ve:
    1. ---------------------------------------------------------------
   
### 5.ICS:
-  #### sh0d4n:

-  #### l4dd3r_l0gic:
    1.The website PLCsimulator was used.

    2.The whole diagram was reconstructed into the simulator.

    3.The different boolean values were entered and given to the differnt 'NO Relay contact', 'NC Relay contact' and 'Output coil'.

    4.The relay contacts were switched to True and False untill all the Output coils glowed green together.

    5.The values of the variables w,x,y and z were False, True, True and False (0110).

    6.Using a MD5 Hash Decoder, the flag was figured out to be '2a66acbc1c39026b5d70457bb71b142b'.

    7.The flag didn't seem to be working at first, but after a fix, the task was completed.
