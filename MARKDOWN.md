## Challenges:

### 1.Web:
-  #### Simple Web:
    1.Opened the Deployment of the website.
   
    2.Clicked on inspect and headed to the Sources page and chose script.js.

   3.Scrolled down untill a list of words was found and looked promising enough to be the flag.

   4.Used Base64 in order to decode the given text.

   5.The flag was wired{m5_Dh0n1_1S_b3sT_c4Pt14N}

   6.Another way to get the flag was to figure out the Username and Password to the website. This would display a pop up which shows u the flag to be deciphered.
    
### 2.Crypto:
-  #### Crypto Layers:
    1.In order to recieve the flag, the message had to be decoded in Binary > Caesar(shift of 5) > Vignere.

    2.The Binary text was converted into Swby70Hqd3u5Jn3S00q (into Caesar).

    3.The Caesar text was converted into Nrwt70Cly3p5Ei3N00l (into Vignere) with a shift of 5.

    4.The Vignere text was converted into Cryp70Lay3r5Ar3C00l (the flag) with the key as "LAYER".

    5.The HINT really helped me to get throught and solve the challenge.
-  #### da_french_cipher:
    1.wmzsx{w3pk0a3_n0_tl3_e0ffd_0j_k1db3rw} had to be decoded using a french cipher language.

    2.It could either be Caesar or Vignere. Vignere was used to decipher the message in order to get the flag.

    3.wmzsx{w3pk0a3_n0_tl3_e0ffd_0j_k1db3rw} was converted into wired{w3lc0m3_t0_th3_w0rld_0f_c1ph3rs} with keys as the vowels (AEIOU).
